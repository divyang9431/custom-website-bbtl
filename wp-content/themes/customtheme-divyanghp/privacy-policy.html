<p>When you use the site or purchase from us, we’ll collect some data automatically like your ip address, browser you use, pages you view on our site, links you click and also would ask you to provide information including your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, phone number, credit card/payment details and optional account information like username and password.

<h6>Embedded Content From Other Websites</h6>

<br />


<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>



<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>



<p>YouTube</p>



<p>Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.</p>

<p>If you’re logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>



<p>YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p>



<p>Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of YouTube under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</a>.</p>
